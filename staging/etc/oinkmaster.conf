# This file is pretty big by default, but don't worry. 
# Everything in here is completely optional and the defaults
# should work for most people. The download URL of the rules
# archive must be set either in here or on the command line.

# Remember not to let untrusted users edit Oinkmaster configuration
# files, as things like the PATH to use during execution is defined
# in here.



# Use "url = <url>" to specify the location of the rules archive to 
# download. The url must begin with http://, https://, ftp://, file:// 
# or scp:// and end with .tar.gz or .tgz, and the file must be a 
# gzipped tarball what contains a directory named "rules".
# You can also point to a local directory with dir://<directory>.
# Multiple "url = <url>" lines can be specified to grab multiple rules
# archives from different locations.
#
# Note: if URL is specified on the command line, it overrides all 
#       possible URLs specified in the configuration file(s).
#
# The location of the official Snort rules you should use depends
# on which Snort version you run. Basically, you should go to
# http://www.snort.org/rules/ and follow the instructions
# there to pick the right URL for your version of Snort
# (and remember to update the URL when upgrading Snort in the
# future!). You can of course also specify locations to third party 
# rules. You may specify multiple URLs.
#
# As of March 2005, you must register on the Snort site to get access 
# to the official Snort rules. This will get you an "oinkcode".
# You then specify the URL as
# http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/oinkmaster.cgi/<oinkcode>/<filename>
# For example, if your code is 5a081649c06a277e1022e1284b and
# you use Snort 2.7, the url to use would be:
# http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/oinkmaster.cgi/5a081649c06a277e1022e1284bdc8fabda70e2a4/snortrules-snapshot-2.7.tar.gz
# See the Oinkmaster FAQ Q1 and http://www.snort.org/rules/ for
# more information.


# URL examples follows. Replace <oinkcode> with the code you get on the 
# Snort site in your registered user profile.


# VRT certified rules for registered users, Snort 2.7.
# url = http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/oinkmaster.cgi/<oinkcode>/snortrules-snapshot-2.7.tar.gz

# VRT certified rules for registered users, Snort 2.8.
# url = http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/oinkmaster.cgi/<oinkcode>/snortrules-snapshot-2.8.tar.gz

# VRT certified rules for registered users, Snort-CURRENT
# ("CURRENT" here means experimental snapshots!).
# url = http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/oinkmaster.cgi/<oinkcode>/snortrules-snapshot-CURRENT.tar.gz


# Community rules and Snort 2.4.
# url = http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/downloads.cgi/Download/comm_rules/Community-Rules-2.4.tar.gz

# Community rules for snort-CURRENT
# url = http://www.snort.org/pub-bin/downloads.cgi/Download/comm_rules/Community-Rules-CURRENT.tar.gz


# Example for rules from the Emerging Threats site (previously known as Bleeding Snort).
# url = http://www.emergingthreats.net/rules/emerging.rules.tar.gz
# Old url:
# url = http://www.emergingthreats.net/rules/bleeding.rules.tar.gz
url = http://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata/emerging.rules.tar.gz

# If you prefer to download the rules archive from outside Oinkmaster,
# you can then point to the file on your local filesystem by using
# file://<filename>, for example:
# url = file:///tmp/snortrules.tar.gz

# In rare cases you may want to grab the rules directly from a
# local directory (don't confuse this with the output directory).
# url = dir:///etc/snort/src/rules

# Example to use scp to copy the rules archive from another host.
# Only OpenSSH is tested. See the FAQ for more information.
# url = scp://user@somehost.example.com:/somedir/snortrules.tar.gz

# If you use -u scp://... and need to specify a private ssh key (passed 
# as -i <key> to the scp command) you can specify it here or add an 
# entry in ~/.ssh/config for the Oinkmaster user as described in the 
# OpenSSH manual. 
# scp_key = /home/oinkmaster/oinkmaster_privkey


# The PATH to use during execution. If you prefer to use external 
# binaries (i.e. use_external_bins=1, see below), tar and gzip must be 
# found, and also wget if downloading via ftp, http or https. All with 
# optional .exe suffix. If you're on Cygwin, make sure that the path 
# contains the Cygwin binaries and not the native Win32 binaries or 
# you will get problems.
# The following UNIX style path is assumed by default:
# path = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

# Example if running native Win32 or standalone Cygwin:
# path = c:\oinkmaster;c:\oinkmaster\bin

# Example if running standalone Cygwin and you prefer Cygwin style path:
# path = /cygdrive/c/oinkmaster:/cygdrive/c/oinkmaster/bin


# We normally use external binaries (wget, tar and gzip) since they're 
# already available on most systems and do a good job. If you have the 
# Perl modules Archive::Tar, IO::Zlib and LWP::UserAgent, you can use
# those instead if you like. You can set use_external_bins below to 
# choose which method you prefer. It's set to 0 by default on Win32 
# (i.e. use Perl modules), and 1 on other systems (i.e. use external 
# binaries). The reason for that is that the required Perl modules
# are included on Windows/ActivePerl 5.8.1+, so it's easier to use 
# those than to install the ported Unix tools. (Note that if you're 
# using scp to download the archive, external scp  binary is still 
# used.) 
# use_external_bins = 0


# Temporary directory to use. This directory must exist when starting and
# Oinkmaster will then create a temporary sub directory in here.
# Keep it as a #comment if you want to use the default.
# The default will be checked for in the environment variables TMP,
# TMPDIR or TEMPDIR, or otherwise use "/tmp" if none of them was set.

# Example for UNIX.
# tmpdir = /home/oinkmaster/tmp/

# Example if running native Win32 or Cygwin.
# tmpdir = c:\tmp

# Example if running Cygwin and you prefer Cygwin style path.
# tmpdir = /cygdrive/c/tmp


# The umask to use during execution if you want it to be something
# else than the current value when starting Oinkmaster.
# This will affect the mode bits when writing new files.
# Keep it commented out to keep your system's current umask.
# umask = 0027


# Files in the archive(s) matching this regular expression will be 
# checked for changes, and then updated or added if needed.
# All other files will be ignored. You can then choose to skip
# individual files by specifying the "skipfile" keyword below.
# Normally you shouldn't need to change this one.
# update_files = \.rules$|\.config$|\.conf$|\.txt$|\.map$


# Regexp of keywords that starts a Snort rule.
# May be useful if you create your own ruletypes and want those
# lines to be regarded as rules as well.
# rule_actions = alert|drop|log|pass|reject|sdrop|activate|dynamic


# If the number of rules files in the downloaded archive matching the
# 'update_files' regexp is below min_files, or if the number
# of rules is below min_rules, the rules are regarded as broken
# and the update is aborted with an error message.
# Both are set to 1 by default (i.e. the archive is only regarded as
# broken if it's totally empty).
# If you download from multiple URLs, the count is the total number
# of files/rules across all archives.
# min_files = 1
# min_rules = 1


# By default, a basic sanity check is performed on most paths/filenames 
# to see if they contain illegal characters that may screw things up. 
# If this check is too strict for your system (e.g. you get bogus 
# "illegal characters in filename" errors because of your local language 
# etc) and you're sure you want to disable the checks completely,
# set use_path_checks to 0.
# use_path_checks = 1


# If you want Oinkmaster to send a User-Agent HTTP header string
# other than the default one for wget/LWP, set this variable.
# user_agent = Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

# The normal Snort rules usually resides in a directory called 
# "rules" in the downloaded archive. You can tell Oinkmaster to 
# look in another directory by setting the rules_dir statement.
# This allows you to update the shared object rules (so_rules) with 
# Oinkmaster by creating a separate oinkmaster.conf containing 
# "rules_dir = so_rules". Note that you can not set multiple
# directories so you have to run Oinkmaster separately for each 
# directory. Remember to point to different output directories as 
# the "rules" and "so_rules" directories contains files with 
# identical filenames.
# To update the shared object rules, use:
# rules_dir = so_rules
# The default is to update the normal rules:
# rules_dir = rules

# You can include other files anywhere in here by using
# "include <file>". <file> will be parsed just like a regular 
# oinkmaster.conf as soon as the include statement is seen, and then 
# return and continue parsing the rest of the original file. If an 
# option is redefined, it will override the previous value. You can use 
# as many "include" statements as you wish, and also include even more 
# files from included files. Example to load stuff from "/etc/foo.conf".
# include /etc/foo.conf

# If the argument is in the form something.something it's regarded       #

# The strings within the quotes will basically be passed to a            #
# s/replacethis/withthis/ statement in Perl, so they must be valid       #
# regular expressions. The strings are case-insensitive and only the     #
# first occurrence will be replaced. If there are multiple occurrences   #
# you want to replace, simply repeat the same modifysid line.            #
# As the strings are regular expressions, you MUST escape special        #
# characters like $ \ / ( ) | by prepending a "\" to them.               #
#                                                                        #
# If you specify a modifysid statement for a multi-line rule, Oinkmaster #
# will first translate the rule into a single-line version and then      #
# perform the substitution, so you don't have to care about the trailing #
# backslashes and newlines.                                              #

# If you use backreference variables in the substitution expression,     #
# it's strongly recommended to specify them as ${1} instead of $1 and so #
# on, to avoid parsing confusion with unexpected results in some         #
# situations. Note that modifysid statements will process both active    #
# and inactive (disabled) rules.                                         #
#                                                                        #
# You may want to check out README.templates and template-examples.conf  #

##########################################################################

# Example to enable a rule (in this case SID 1325) that is disabled by
# default, by simply replacing leading "#alert" with "alert".
# (You should really use 'enablesid' for this though.)
# Oinkmaster removes whitespaces next to the leading "#" so you don't
# have to worry about that, but be careful about possible whitespace in
# other places when writing the regexps.
# modifysid 1325 "^#alert" | "alert"

# You could also do this to enable it no matter what type of rule it is
# (alert, log, pass, etc).
# modifysid 1325 "^#" | ""

# Example to enable ALL rules in ALL files (usually not a good idea).
# modifysid * "^#" | ""

# Example to add "tag" stuff to SID 1325.
# modifysid 1325 "sid:1325;" | "sid:1325; tag: host, src, 300, seconds;"

# Example to make SID 1378 a 'drop' rule (valid if you're running 
# Snort_inline).
# modifysid 1378 "^alert" | "drop"

# Example to replace first occurrence of $EXTERNAL_NET with $HOME_NET 
# in SID 302.
# modifysid 302 "\$EXTERNAL_NET" | "\$HOME_NET"

# You can also specify that a substitution should apply on multiple SIDs.
# modifysid 302,429,1821 "\$EXTERNAL_NET" | "\$HOME_NET"

# You can take advantage of the fact that it's regular expressions and
# do more complex stuff. This example (for Snort_inline) adds a 'replace'
# statement to SID 1324 that replaces "/bin/sh" with "/foo/sh".
# modifysid 1324 "(content\s*:\s*"\/bin\/sh"\s*;)" | \
#                "${1} replace:"\/foo\/sh";"

# If you for some reason would like to add a comment inside the actual 
# rules file, like the reason why you disabled this rule, you can do 
# like this (you would normally add such comments in oinkmaster.conf 
# though).
# modifysid 1324 "(.+)" | "# 20020101: disabled this rule just for fun:\n#${1}"

# Here is an example that is actually useful. Let's say you don't care 
# about incoming welchia pings (detected by SID 483 at the time of 
# writing) but you want to know when infected hosts on your network 
# scans hosts on the outside. (Remember that watching for outgoing 
# malicious packets is often just as important as watching for incoming 
# ones, especially in this case.) The rule currently looks like
# "alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any ..."
# but we want to switch that so it becomes
# "alert icmp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any ...".
# Here is how it could be done.
# modifysid 483 \
# "(.+) \$EXTERNAL_NET (.+) \$HOME_NET (.+)" | \
# "${1} \$HOME_NET ${2} \$EXTERNAL_NET ${3}"

# The wildcard (modifysid * ...) can be used to do all kinds of 
# interesting things. The substitution expression will be applied on all 
# matching rules. First, a silly example to replace "foo" with "bar" in 
# all rules (that have the string "foo" in them, that is.) 
# modifysid * "foo" | "bar"

# If you for some reason don't want to use the stream preprocessor to 
# match established streams, you may want to replace the 'flow' 
# statement with 'flags:A+;' in all those rules.
# modifysid * "flow:[a-z,_ ]+;" | "flags:A+;"

# Example to convert all rules of classtype attempted-admin to 'drop' 
# rules (for Snort_inline only, obviously).
# modifysid * "^alert (.*classtype\s*:\s*attempted-admin)" | "drop ${1}"

# This one will append some text to the 'msg' string for all rules that 
# have the 'tag' keyword in them.
# modifysid * "(.*msg:\s*".+?)"(\s*;.+;\s*tag:.*)" | \
#             "${1}, going to tag this baby"${2}"

# There may be times when you want to replace multiple occurrences of a 
# certain keyword/string in a rule and not just the first one. To 
# replace the first two occurrences of "foo" with "bar" in SID 100, 
# simply repeat the modifysid statement:
# modifysid 100 "foo" | "bar"
# modifysid 100 "foo" | "bar"
 
# Or you can even specify a SID list but repeat the same SID as many 
# times as required, like:
# modifysid 100,100,100 "foo" | "bar"

# Enable all rules in the file exploit.rules.
# modifysid exploit.rules "^#" | ""

# Enable all rules in exploit.rules, icmp-info.rules and also SID 1171.
# modifysid exploit.rules, snmp.rules, 1171 "^#" | ""
